# Code for "Don't trust your eyes: on the (un)reliability of feature visualizations"

This repository contains code to replicate experiments from [Don't trust your eyes: on the (un)reliability of feature visualizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04719) by Robert Geirhos*, Roland S. Zimmermann*, Blair Bilodeau*, Wieland Brendel, and Been Kim.

## Fooling feature visualizations
Feature visualizations are widely used interpretability tools - but can we trust them? We investigate this question from an adversarial, empirical and theoretical perspective. The result: Donâ€™t trust your eyes!

For instance, from an adversarial perspective we can adapt a model such that it maintains identical behavior on natural image input (e.g., identical ImageNet accuracy) but its feature visualizations are changed completely. In the example here, the feature visualization shows a painting (right) instead of the original feature visualization (left).
